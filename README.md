# Basic Thief Detector (ESP32)

This project uses an ESP32 to detect a condition via an LDR sensor, displays an alert message on a 7-segment display, and triggers a buzzer when an alert condition is detected.

## Features
- Detects input from an LDR sensor.
- Displays "Alert" on a 7-segment display when triggered.
- Buzzer sounds when the alert condition is met.

## Hardware Required
- ESP32 microcontroller
- 7-segment display
- LDR sensor
- Buzzer
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires

## How to Use
1. Connect the components to the ESP32.
2. Upload the code to the ESP32 using the Arduino IDE.
3. When the LDR sensor reads a certain value, the 7-segment display will show "Alert" and the buzzer will sound.
